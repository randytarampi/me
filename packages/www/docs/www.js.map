I think that\n                        you folks do these things (amongst others) and have a culture of quality that extends past your\n                        product and to your staff, and I hope to gain from it.\n                    </p>\n                </Fragment>\n            }\n        </div>\n    </LeftDescriptionSection>;\n};\n\nLetterQuality.propTypes = {\n    letter: PropTypes.object.isRequired,\n    contentConfiguration: PropTypes.object.isRequired\n};\n\nexport default LetterQuality;\n","import {PrintableSection} from \"@randy.tarampi/jsx\";\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\";\nimport React, {Fragment} from \"react\";\n\nexport const PrintableRecipient = ({letter, contentConfiguration}) => {\n    if (!letter.recipient) {\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    return <PrintableSection\n        {...contentConfiguration.contentProps}\n        type={contentConfiguration.contentKey}\n        printableType=\"letter\"\n    >\n        {\n            letter.recipient.name\n                ?
