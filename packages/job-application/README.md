Tie together [letter](../letter) and [resume](../resume) to create cohesive job application packages per [#55](https://github.com/randytarampi/me/issues/55).

These PDFs have a couple advantages over the documents generated by [letter](../letter), [resume](../resume) and [jsonresume-theme](../jsonresume-theme):
- Generate both a cover letter and resume for a specific configuration at the same time, useful for consistently capturing time-sensitive information, like [shield](https://github.com/randytarampi/me/tree/master/packages/jsx/src/lib/components/link/shields) statuses.
- Since [v1.2.0](https://github.com/randytarampi/me/commit/171fdfb716b41c55d14d8469dc354c6ffa302a65), we tack on UTM tracking parameters onto each outbound link in both documents 

1. Place a JS/JSX file (say [`some-awesome-company.jsx`](https://github.com/randytarampi/me/blob/master/packages/job-application/src/job-applications/some-awesome-company.jsx)) that returns an instance of [`JobApplication`](./src/lib/jobApplication) in `/src/job-applications`
2. Generate your documents by running `npm run job-applications -- --name some-awesome-company`
3. View them with `open ./dist/some-awesome-company.*.pdf`
